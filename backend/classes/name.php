 * This file contained documentation/instructions and stray code fragments that
 * made the PHP parser fail. Convert the content into a comment so the file
 * remains syntactically valid while preserving the notes for developers.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Do not place 'use' statements inside blocks; prefer top-level imports.
 * - If you need to ensure Session is started, call App\Classes\Session::start()
 *   from a bootstrap or entry-point script where autoloading is guaranteed.
 *
 * The original file had a fragment like:
 *   if (class_exists('\\App\\Classes\\Session')) {
 *       \\App\\Classes\\Session::start();
 *   }
 * which is fine as an example but not as loose code in a class file.
